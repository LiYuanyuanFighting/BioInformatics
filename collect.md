**To reduce imbalance**  
You can change the dataset that you use to build your predictive model to have more balanced data.

This change is called sampling your dataset and there are two main methods that you can use to even-up the classes:

    You can add copies of instances from the under-represented class called over-sampling (or more formally sampling with replacement), or
    You can delete instances from the over-represented class, called under-sampling.

These approaches are often very easy to implement and fast to run. They are an excellent starting point.

In fact, I would advise you to always try both approaches on all of your imbalanced datasets, just to see if it gives you a boost in your preferred accuracy measures.  

Consider testing under-sampling when you have an a lot data (tens- or hundreds of thousands of instances or more)
Consider testing over-sampling when you donâ€™t have a lot of data (tens of thousands of records or less)
